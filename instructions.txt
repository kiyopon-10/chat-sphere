1) Create a folder chat-sphere

2) Create a virtual environment using command python -m venv venv
  Use command .\venv\Scripts\activate to activate it

3) Create a django folder inside it named chatSphere

4) For using environment variablesuse command pip install python-dotenv

   The problem of leaving such sensitive information here in our code base is that anyone who accesses
   our code base can then access this sensitive information.
   For example, in this case the database username and password.
   So once we have identified the values that need to be stored as environment variables, we can then
   go ahead and create the configuration file or script that sets up these values for our application.
   We do this by using the environment variable.
   The actual variable that we set is going to be stored in the operating system and we're going to access
   that within our application by following this type of approach.
   It means that we're not typing in in clear text, username and passwords within our code base and therefore
   we're providing an extra layer of security.
   Anyone who may access our code base will not be able to view in clear text the username and passwords
   or any other sensitive data.
   We're going to set up our environment variables using python dot env.

5) Create a file .env in the chatSphere root folder

6) In the env file keep the secret key and the debug = true

7) We make a couple of imports in the settings.py for accessing those environment variables and change the way of accessing
   secret key and debug.

8) We are gonna make a file called .gitignore inside the chat-sphere folder for storing things which shouldn't be tracked by
   github. We ignore the .env because of course we don't want that in our repo. We create a file called .env-example
   which will keep track of what information needs to present but doesn't actually keep the information.

9) We are use command pip freeze > requirements.txt for creating a requirements.txt which has all the required dependencies
   and packages recorded

Part 2:

Chat Server Adminstraion api

1) Create an app called server for handling the chat adminstraton.

2) We are gonna incorporate the feature of user authentication in the app at some point, so we will start with creating a custom
   User model. The Django documentation does recommend defining a custom user model at the beginning of the project
   rather than using the built in user model. Now, this allows for greater flexibility and customization in terms of adding additional 
   fields, changing the authentication method and integrating with maybe third party packages, all of which we probably want to do on 
   this project.

3) We are gonna create another app called account that will manage the users.

4) In account/models.py we create a class called Account.

5) We set the AUTH_USER_MODEL to the custom model we created in settings.py

6) We setup databases now. We don't have an idea of what data exactly needs to be handles yet, but we start with models
  Category, Server, Channels. There will be categories and in each category there will be multiple servers and in each
  server there will be multiple channels where people can talk.
